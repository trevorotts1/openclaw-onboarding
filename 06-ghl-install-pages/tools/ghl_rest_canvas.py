"""ghl_rest_canvas.py — the cracked GoHighLevel internal-SPA REST surface
(Family A, "canvas-REST"), packaged as reusable, additive helpers.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
The companion solver doc (``GHL-HEADLESS-CANVAS-SOLUTION-2026-06-22.md``) proved
that two capabilities once believed to require driving the visual canvas are in
fact plain ``token-id``-authenticated XHRs against the GHL SPA's internal REST
surface:

  1. Page/funnel/website content read + edit + SAVE
       GET  /funnels/page/<pageId>                     (read the editable blob)
       POST /funnels/builder/autosave/<pageId>         (save a DRAFT)
  2. Workflow trigger read + rewire
       GET  /workflow/<loc>/<wf>?includeTriggers=true  (read WITH triggers)
       PUT  /workflow/<loc>/trigger/<id>               (rewire a native trigger)
  3. NET-NEW funnel + page CREATE (and reversible delete) — added after the
     prior runs were capped for building Lumiere content on pre-existing,
     semantically-mismatched template pages (they had no create primitive and
     wrongly concluded net-new creation was canvas-only). The REAL routes:
       POST /funnels/funnel/create                     (net-new funnel; 201)
       POST /funnels/funnel/create-step                (net-new step + PAGE; 201)
       GET  /funnels/funnel/fetch/<id>                 (authoritative read; /fetch/!)
       GET  /funnels/page/list?funnelId=&locationId=   (pages in a funnel)
       POST /funnels/funnel/delete {loc,funnelId,userId} (reversible cleanup; 201)
     With these, a build creates its OWN funnel + pages at matching slugs, then
     uses capability (1) to inject content — instead of clobbering a template.

This module owns the deterministic, mechanical parts of that recipe — path
construction, payload shaping, the pure JSON splice that performs the GAP-1
image / Code-element swap, the ``?includeTriggers=true`` read contract, the
reversibility (byte-identical revert) helper, the token-staging-via-python-
written-JS detail, and a thin agent-browser-eval wrapper — so they are never
improvised.

WHAT THIS IS *NOT*
------------------
THIS IS THE GLUE, NOT THE CLICKER (same boundary as ``ghl_builder.py``). It
emits the JS the agent runs *inside the agent-browser*; it does not itself open,
drive, or talk to a browser, and it makes NO network calls of its own. Every
funnels/builder route is Cloudflare-WAF-gated (error 1010 for bare HTTP), so the
GET/POST/PUT MUST run from inside the agent-browser ``eval`` context, which
carries the Cloudflare clearance + real browser UA automatically. This module
produces the eval steps; the agent executes them.

AUTH (token-only — reuse, do not re-implement)
----------------------------------------------
Reuses the existing Tier-1 token-only path: ``seed-ghl-auth.py`` mints the
Firebase ``id_token``; that value is the ``token-id`` header on every call here.
No UI login, no password, no two-factor. ``Authorization: Bearer <id_token>``
returns 401 — the header MUST be ``token-id``.

D6 HEADLESS: every agent-browser invocation this module emits is forced headless
via ``ghl_builder.browser_cmd`` (``--headed false``). There is no code path here
that can open a visible window.

RESIDUALS (carried verbatim from the solver doc §7)
---------------------------------------------------
  * Going LIVE requires a CLIENT "Connect Domain" step — never automated.
    Automation only ever produces ``/preview/<pageId>`` URLs.
  * No clean single-version delete of a draft snapshot — revert re-posts the
    pristine blob as a NEW draft version; the LIVE pointer never moves and the
    content is byte-identical, but the append-only draft history accrues rows
    (GHL auto-prunes at ~30). Reversibility bar = "live pointer unchanged +
    content byte-identical", not "zero extra draft rows".
  * The /funnels/* routes MUST run in-browser (Cloudflare 1010 from bare Python).

    STORAGE vs RENDER (mandatory reading):
    ---------------------------------------
    A ``POST /funnels/builder/autosave/<pageId>`` returning HTTP 201 and the
    marker being present in the *stored* bytes proves ONLY that the GoHighLevel
    storage layer accepted the bytes. It does NOT prove the page renders.
    GoHighLevel's renderer reads ``blob['general']['general']['colors']`` during
    its React hydration cycle. If that key is absent the renderer throws:

        TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'colors')

    and returns HTTP 500 or a blank page — even though the autosave returned 201
    and the marker is in the stored blob.

    ``defaultSettings.colors`` does NOT exist in real GoHighLevel page blobs.
    The correct path is ``general.general.colors`` — an 18-entry
    ``[{label, value}]`` palette array.  ``pageStyles`` is a top-level CSS
    string (```:root { --primary: #37ca37; ... }```), NOT a nested object.

    Renderability is proven only by ``ghl_verify.render_check`` (HTTP 200 +
    marker in the RENDERED JavaScript-hydrated DOM, not raw bytes).

    Required structure rules:
    - ``general.general.colors``: non-empty list of ``{label, value}`` dicts
    - ``pageStyles``: top-level CSS string with ``--primary`` etc.
    - Funnel element: ``type=element, meta=custom-code`` at
      ``sections[0].elements[idx].extra.customCode.value.rawCustomCode``
    - Website element: ``type=code, elType=code`` at
      ``sections[0].elements[0].extra.customCode.value.rawCustomCode``
    - ``rawCustomCode`` MUST be a body-level HTML FRAGMENT (no ``<!DOCTYPE>``
      or ``<html>`` wrapper) — use ``html_fragment()`` to strip those.

    Args:
        raw_custom_code: The page's HTML fragment (e.g. the hero markup + real
            ``<img>`` CDN tag + the per-page marker).  Full ``<!DOCTYPE html>``
            documents are accepted and stripped automatically by ``html_fragment()``.
        surface: ``"funnel"`` (default) or ``"website"``.  Determines which
            golden reference is loaded and which element node shape is produced.
        head_code: Optional ``trackingCode.head`` content.

    Returns:
        A complete ``pageData`` blob loaded from the golden reference, with
        fresh IDs minted, the custom-code element's ``rawCustomCode`` set to
        the normalised fragment, and the shape validated by
        ``assert_renderable_shape`` before return.
