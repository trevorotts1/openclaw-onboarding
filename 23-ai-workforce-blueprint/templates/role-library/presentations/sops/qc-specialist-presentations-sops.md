## 9. Standard Operating Procedures (Numbered)

Master authority: universal-sops/CLIENT-WEBINAR-DECK-SOP.md

### AUTO-FAIL RULE: an auto-fail condition forces FAIL for that item regardless of any average. Auto-fails are checked FIRST, before scoring.

#### Copy QC Auto-Fails (SOP 9.1)

The following conditions each independently force an immediate FAIL verdict on the affected slide. Check these before assigning any scores. Document every triggered auto-fail by criterion code in the QC report.

| Code | Auto-Fail Condition |
|------|---------------------|
| AF-C1 | Any em dash in any field of any slide. The em dash is the dead giveaway of unedited AI output. |
| AF-C2 | Hook count below 7 across the deck (mechanical count; count every tagged HOOK_REFRAIN occurrence and the dedicated hook slide). Fewer than 7 = auto-fail. |
| AF-C3 | Any fabricated proof or statistic not traceable to intake.json or proof_audit.txt. A number not present in the intake or research brief = auto-fail on that slide. |
| AF-C4 | Any cross-slide numeric mismatch (e.g., stack total stated as $5,282 on one slide and $5,276 on another). Defer the Offer Strategist mechanics to SOP 9.3, but a FAIL there blocks this gate. The QC agent compiles all repeated numbers and diffs them; any mismatch auto-fails all slides carrying the inconsistent value. |
| AF-C5 | Headline over 9 words (mechanical word count; count is exact). |

#### Prompt QC Auto-Fails (SOP 9.2)

Check these before scoring. Each independently forces FAIL on the affected prompt.

| Code | Auto-Fail Condition |
|------|---------------------|
| AF-P1 | Character count under 1500 (Check 0: count mechanically and RECORD the exact number in the report). |
| AF-P2 | Character count over 15000. |
| AF-P3 | Headline not verbatim to slides_copy.md HEADLINE field (any paraphrase, any changed word = auto-fail). |
| AF-P4 | Missing 16:9 or 2K (either absent = auto-fail). |
| AF-P5 | Dark background language present without DARK_OK = true. |
| AF-P6 | Missing thirds/zone language (explicit thirds placement for headline, people, and objects is required; "centered" alone is not thirds language). |
| AF-P7 | People are present in the slide spec but the prompt is missing any of: hair description, clothing description, or facial expression description. All three are required when people appear. |
| AF-P8 | Missing AVOID block (the closing constraints block listing negatives is mandatory in every prompt). |

#### Image QC Auto-Fails (SOP 9.3)

Check these before scoring. Each independently forces FAIL on the affected image.

| Code | Auto-Fail Condition |
|------|---------------------|
| AF-I1 | ANY misspelling, duplicated word, or garbled glyph in ANY rendered text anywhere on the slide. This applies to every word on the slide, not just the headline. Inspect all text elements. |
| AF-I2 | Any deformity: malformed hands, extra or missing fingers, distorted faces, warped or severed limbs. |
| AF-I3 | Wrong aspect ratio (must be 16:9; anything else = auto-fail). |
| AF-I4 | Missing or mangled logo when LOGO_ON_SLIDES = true (logo absent, illegible, distorted, or incorrectly placed = auto-fail). |
| AF-I5 | Dark background without DARK_OK = true. |
| AF-I6 | Emoji or clipart glyphs rendered anywhere in the image. Premium decks use photography and typography only. |
| AF-I7 | An em dash rendered in slide text. |

### SOP 9.1 -- Copy QC Gate (Phase 1Q)

**When to run:** Phase 1Q -- immediately after the Slide Copywriter delivers slides_copy.md and proof_audit.txt. Runs before the owner approval gate (Phase 1A).

**Inputs:**
- working/copy/slides_copy.md
- working/copy/proof_audit.txt
- working/copy/hook_variants.json
- working/copy/intake.json (for comparison on proof claims and prices)

**Steps:**
1. For every slide, check ALL five Copy QC Auto-Fails (AF-C1 through AF-C5) BEFORE scoring. Record each triggered auto-fail by code in the report. A slide with any auto-fail is marked FAIL immediately.
2. Dispatch 3-5 QC agents (minimax-m3:cloud) each independently scoring slides_copy.md on all 17 criteria. Each agent returns a score per criterion per slide.
3. Average the agent scores for each criterion across all slides. Compute the overall average.
4. Apply double-weight to criteria 1, 2, 7, 11, 12, and 15 (these are the most critical -- see criteria list below).
5. Write the copy_qc_report.json. One entry per slide, plus a summary. Structure:
   ```json
   {
     "gate": "Phase 1Q",
     "overall_average": 0.0,
     "weighted_average": 0.0,
     "auto_fails_triggered": [],
     "pass": true,
     "per_slide_scores": [
       {"slide": N, "auto_fails": [], "scores": {"c1": 0, "c2": 0, ...}, "average": 0.0, "pass": true, "notes": ""}
     ],
     "failing_slides": [],
     "revision_instructions": []
   }
   ```
6. For every slide with an auto-fail or scoring < 8.5: write specific revision_instructions. Each instruction must name the criterion or auto-fail code, the specific failure, and the required fix. Example: "Slide 12, AF-C5 (headline word count): headline is 11 words (max 9). Trim to: 'Your clients come to you every week.'"
7. If overall weighted_average >= 8.5 AND no individual slide scores below 7.0 AND no auto-fails: pass. Write `pass: true`.
8. If any slide scores below 7.0 OR overall weighted_average < 8.5 OR any auto-fail triggered: fail. Write `pass: false`. Send revision_instructions to the Slide Copywriter.
9. Increment `loop_count` in the report. If loop_count reaches 4 without a pass: escalate to the Director with the specific persistent failures.

**The 17 Copy QC Criteria (c1-c17):**
1. (double-weight) Hook appears >= 7 times across the deck, well-distributed (not clustered).
2. (double-weight) Every headline is 9 words or fewer. Count is exact.
3. Every subhead is 18 words or fewer.
4. Body copy is 3 bullets max or 30 words max per slide.
5. Slides are one big idea each. No slide tries to do two things.
6. Presentation arc is complete: hook / problem / solution / proof / offer / price / close.
7. (double-weight) No em dashes anywhere in any field.
8. PRESENTER NOTE is present and substantive (not a duplicate of the slide copy) for every slide.
9. Price Ladder slides reference prices from price_ladder.json exactly (Offer Price Strategist cross-check).
10. Proof slides contain only items from the proof inventory (proof_audit.txt shows VERIFIED or PENDING -- never fabricated).
11. (double-weight) No fabricated statistics (any number not in intake.json is flagged).
12. (double-weight) No literal client names ({{TOKENS}} used wherever a real name would appear).
13. Every slide has a SECTION label matching arc_allocation.json.
14. Mode B slides: augmented slides preserve original copy per SOP 9.4 of slide-copywriter.
15. (double-weight) Doctrine battery -- ALL of the following must pass (each sub-item that fails is a criterion-15 failure):
    - Promises pitched, not products (every teach and offer slide pitches a promise, not a product feature).
    - Every DROP adds named value (the drop slide or its immediate successor names additional value added to the table; no drop strips value).
    - Offer serves BOTH emotion AND logic (emotionally driven imagery and future-pacing present, AND explicit math or priceless-pitch reasoning present in the offer section).
    - Cost-versus-value explicitly answered: if the offer produces money, the math is on screen; if non-monetary, the priceless pitch frame is used. Dollar values are never fabricated for non-monetary outcomes.
    - Light pitches woven throughout (the program is named and referenced inside the teaching sections, not only in the offer section).
    - Appetizer not dinner (each Secret teaches the WHAT and WHY and one quick win; the complete HOW lives inside the offer -- a Secret that hands over the complete HOW = fail).
    - At least one intrigue slide per section (a slide that makes the audience ask a question).
    - Compare/contrast device present in every Secret (old-way vs new-way or equivalent two-sided belief-shift mechanism).
    - A paid pitch exists (unless the owner has signed off on free-only in writing).
16. TEXT_ANCHOR variation: no more than 2 consecutive slides share the same TEXT_ANCHOR value. The QC agent checks the sequence of TEXT_ANCHOR fields in slides_copy.md and flags any run of 3 or more identical anchors.
17. Ladder integrity (all sub-items must pass):
    - ANCHOR slide carries the explicit memory hook ("Remember this number. Keep watching." or equivalent).
    - A BUILDUP slide immediately precedes every DROP slide (no DROP without a BUILDUP).
    - At least one callback is present in the offer section explicitly referencing the ANCHOR.
    - FINAL price sits below all ladder rungs (strictly less than DROP3 in drop mode).

**Outputs:**
- working/qc/copy_qc_report.json

**Hand to:** Director (pass = proceed to Phase 1A owner approval; fail = back to Slide Copywriter)

**Failure mode:** If QC agents are unavailable (model down), use a single agent with 2 passes (the agent scores each criterion twice and averages). If still unavailable after 30 minutes, escalate to the Director.

---

### SOP 9.2 -- Prompt QC Gate (Phase 3, Dual-Scored)

**When to run:** Phase 3 -- immediately after the Slide Image Creator delivers all prompt files in working/prompts/.

**Inputs:**
- working/prompts/slide-NN-prompt.txt (all files)
- working/copy/slides_copy.md (for headline verbatim verification)
- working/brand/style_block.md (for brand palette and representation ratio)
- working/copy/price_ladder.json (for price-drop slide verification)

**Steps:**
1. For every prompt, check ALL eight Prompt QC Auto-Fails (AF-P1 through AF-P8) BEFORE scoring. Check 0 (character count) is always first: count mechanically and record the exact integer in the report. A prompt with any auto-fail is marked FAIL immediately; record the code(s).
2. Dispatch 5-10 QC agents (minimax-m3:cloud) in parallel. Each agent independently scores each prompt on all 15 criteria.
3. For each prompt, calculate the per-agent score, then average across all agents.
4. Apply double-weight to criteria 2, 3, 4, and 13 (the most commonly failing and highest impact).
5. Write prompt_qc_report.json. One entry per prompt (one per slide), including the recorded character count and any auto-fail codes.
6. For any prompt with an auto-fail or scoring < 8.5: write specific revision_instructions. Instructions must specify the failing auto-fail code or criterion and the exact change required.
7. Identify fail classification for each failing prompt: render-noise (image quality issues likely in generation), prompt-defect (structural problem with the prompt itself), or text-fail (headline text will not render correctly -- mark as text-fail-x2 if two text elements fail).
8. Pass: overall weighted average >= 8.5, no individual prompt below 7.0, no auto-fails. Fail: otherwise.
9. Increment loop_count. At loop_count = 4, escalate.

**The 15 Prompt QC Criteria (p1-p15):**
1. All 15 elements present in order (format / background / headline verbatim / typography / font placement / thirds / object placement / overlays / brand palette / logo / people / bullets / mood / professionalism / closing constraints).
2. (double-weight) Headline text is verbatim match to slides_copy.md HEADLINE field (not paraphrased).
3. (double-weight) Character count is 1,500-15,000. Target 5,000-7,500.
4. (double-weight) White base rule: element 2 specifies white background (unless DARK_OK=true).
5. People element (11) specifies at least one of the 3 engines with representation group and gender.
6. Thirds-grid assignment in element 6 is specific (named regions -- not "somewhere on the right").
7. No em dashes in the prompt body.
8. Brand palette (element 9): all 3 hex codes from STYLE BLOCK listed with roles.
9. Logo placement (element 10): matches STYLE BLOCK logo_placement_rule.
10. Overlays (element 8): present for hook slides per hook_variants.json; absent for non-hook slides.
11. Mood (element 13): specific and appropriate for the arc section.
12. AVOID block (element 15) includes: dark backgrounds, watermarks, em dashes, any unspecified text.
13. (double-weight) Representation ratio: spot-check 10 prompts -- people specifications are consistent with STYLE BLOCK representation_ratio.
14. Price-drop slides: struck price and new price match price_ladder.json exactly (verify for any slide in the Price Ladder arc section).
15. Prompt front-loads critical content: composition, people, and headline appear in the first 500 characters.

**Outputs:**
- working/qc/prompt_qc_report.json (with per-prompt character counts, auto-fail codes, scores, fail classifications, revision instructions)

**Hand to:** Director (pass = proceed to Phase 4 generation; fail = back to Slide Image Creator)

**Failure mode:** Same as SOP 9.1 -- fall back to single-agent dual-pass if model is unavailable.

---

### SOP 9.3 -- Image QC Gate (Phase 5) and Fail Classification

**When to run:** Phase 5 -- as each image is downloaded from Kie.ai to working/renders/. Run QC on each image as it arrives; do not wait for all images before starting QC.

**Inputs:**
- working/renders/slide-NN.png (raw downloads)
- working/prompts/slide-NN-prompt.txt (the prompt that generated this image)
- working/copy/slides_copy.md (for visual text verification and slide MOOD/emotion)

**Steps:**
1. For every image, check ALL seven Image QC Auto-Fails (AF-I1 through AF-I7) BEFORE scoring. A triggered auto-fail immediately marks the image FAIL; record the code(s) in the report. Auto-fail inspection includes: reading every word of rendered text on the slide for misspellings, duplicated words, and garbled glyphs (not just the headline -- all text elements); inspecting hands, faces, and limbs for deformities; verifying aspect ratio; verifying logo presence and integrity when LOGO_ON_SLIDES = true; checking background darkness; scanning for emoji or clipart glyphs; checking rendered text for em dashes.
2. Dispatch up to 5 QC agents (minimax-m3:cloud) per batch of images. Each agent scores a non-overlapping batch (e.g., agent 1 handles slides 1-15, agent 2 handles slides 16-30, etc.).
3. Each agent scores each image on all 14 criteria.
4. Apply double-weight to criteria 3, 5, 6, and 7 (most critical for the assembled deck).
5. Write image_qc_report.json with per-image auto-fail codes and scores.
6. For each failing image (auto-fail or score < 8.5): classify the failure type:
   - `render-noise`: generation artifact, blurriness, corrupted output -- re-generate with the same prompt.
   - `prompt-defect`: the prompt produced the wrong composition or wrong mood -- send prompt back to Slide Image Creator for revision, then re-generate.
   - `text-fail`: the headline text is garbled, missing, or wrong -- if one text element is wrong, mark `text-fail-x1`; if two or more, mark `text-fail-x2`. Send back to Slide Image Creator with specific text correction instructions.
7. For render-noise failures: re-generate immediately (up to 3 attempts) without touching the prompt.
8. For prompt-defect or text-fail: send revision instructions to Slide Image Creator, then re-generate.
9. Maximum 3 total attempts per image. At attempt 4: escalate to the Director.
10. Passed images are moved to working/media-library/ immediately (do not wait for full deck pass).

**The 14 Image QC Criteria (i1-i14):**

AUTO-FAIL LAYER (checked first; see AF-I1 through AF-I7 above -- these override scoring):
- i-AF: Any of AF-I1 through AF-I7 triggers a hard FAIL before the scored layer runs.

SCORED LAYER (1-10, applied only after auto-fail check passes):
1. 16:9 aspect ratio, 2K resolution confirmed.
2. White base background (or dark if DARK_OK=true).
3. (double-weight) Headline text is legible, matches slides_copy.md HEADLINE, no garbling. (Note: garbling is also an auto-fail via AF-I1; this criterion scores the degree of legibility and accuracy beyond the binary auto-fail threshold.)
4. Brand palette colors are visible and consistent with STYLE BLOCK.
5. (double-weight) No dark background (unless DARK_OK=true).
6. (double-weight) No watermarks, logos not belonging to the client, no text not in the prompt.
7. (double-weight) People subject(s) present and appropriate (when the prompt specifies people).
8. Logo is present and correctly placed per STYLE BLOCK.
9. Composition follows the thirds-grid assignment in the prompt.
10. No visual artifacts: no blur, no color banding, no corrupted regions.
11. Facial expression MATCHES the slide's emotion: pull the MOOD element from slides_copy.md for the slide being scored. A smiling, relaxed, or triumphant expression on a pain slide fails; a worried or overwhelmed expression on a vision slide fails. Expression must match the declared mood/section.
12. Real-world setting matches the World Engine spec in the prompt (the setting stated in the prompt must appear in the image; a generic studio backdrop where a specific real-world scene was specified = fail).
13. Text edges sharp at 2K (headline and all text elements rendered with crisp, high-resolution edges; soft or anti-aliased text = fail).
14. Mood and energy of the image match the arc section (aspirational for hero slides, urgent for price drops, etc.).

**Outputs:**
- working/qc/image_qc_report.json (per-image auto-fail codes, scores, and classifications)
- Passed images moved to working/media-library/ (the deliverable folder)

**Hand to:** Media Librarian / GHL Updater (passes images to GHL) and Director (for Phase 6 kick-off)

**Failure mode:** If an image fails 3 attempts and still does not pass: escalate to the Director with the image, the prompt, and all 3 QC reports. The Director decides whether to present a best-available image to the owner or wait for manual intervention.

---

### SOP 9.4 -- Revision-Loop Control and Escalation

**When to run:** Any time a QC gate loops back for revision. This SOP governs the loop mechanics.

**Inputs:**
- QC report (from any phase)
- loop_count field from the report

**Steps:**
1. Read the loop_count from the current phase's QC report.
2. If loop_count = 1 or 2: send revision_instructions to the responsible specialist and re-trigger the QC gate after revision.
3. If loop_count = 3: send revision_instructions AND flag to the Director: "Third loop on [phase]. If the next revision fails, I will escalate."
4. If loop_count = 4 (threshold reached): stop looping. Send this exact message to the Director via a checkpoint file: "QC ESCALATION: [phase] has failed [N] loops. Persistent failure on criteria: [list]. Most recent failing slide/prompt/image: [ID]. QC reports are at [path]. Director must intervene."
5. Do not continue the run past an escalated gate until the Director resolves the issue.
6. Record the escalation in working/checkpoints/run_ledger.json under `escalations`.

**Outputs:**
- Revision instructions to the relevant specialist
- Escalation record in run_ledger.json (if loop_count = 4)

**Hand to:** Director (for escalation resolution)

**Failure mode:** This SOP is itself the failure-mode handler for all other QC gates. There is no failure mode of a failure-mode handler -- if this SOP cannot be executed (e.g., QC models are all down), escalate to the Director immediately with the error.

---

### SOP 9.5 -- Final Deck QC (Rendered Pages)

**When to run:** Phase 6 -- after the PPTX Assembly Specialist has assembled the deck and rendered it to PDF (via soffice --headless --convert-to pdf, then pdftoppm -png -r 100).

**Inputs:**
- The assembled PPTX file
- The PDF-rendered pages (PNG files at 100 DPI)
- working/copy/slides_copy.md (for copy verification in assembled deck)
- working/copy/presenter_notes.json (for speaker notes verification)

**Steps:**
1. Review the PDF-rendered pages visually. For each page (slide), verify:
   a. All 14 image QC criteria (including the auto-fail layer) are still satisfied in the rendered output (images from Phase 5 that passed should still pass here -- if they don't, it indicates an assembly error).
   b. All 17 copy QC criteria are satisfied in the text overlays and any PPTX-native text elements.
2. Additionally check 5 final-deck-specific criteria:
   a. Slide order matches arc_allocation.json exactly.
   b. Speaker notes are present in the PPTX for every slide per presenter_notes.json.
   c. No slides are missing (total count matches slide_count_final in mission_prd.json).
   d. No images are stretched, cropped, or misaligned in the PPTX layout.
   e. Font embedding: if PPTX-native text is used, fonts are embedded (verify by opening in a clean environment without the brand fonts installed -- text should still display correctly).
3. Write final_deck_qc_report.json.
4. If pass: notify the Director that Phase 6 is complete and the deck is ready for delivery.
5. If fail: send specific revision instructions to the PPTX Assembly Specialist.

**Outputs:**
- working/qc/final_deck_qc_report.json

**Hand to:** Director (who initiates delivery)

**Failure mode:** If the PPTX file cannot be opened or rendered: escalate to the Director and PPTX Assembly Specialist immediately. Record the technical error in run_ledger.json.
