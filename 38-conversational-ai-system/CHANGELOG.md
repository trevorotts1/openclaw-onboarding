## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-28 - GHL Build-with-AI hardening + calendar-sync (repo v10.15.7)

### Why
A live Mac-mini build surfaced several traps that every future Mac client would otherwise hit:
token confusion (4 distinct secrets), `deliver: true` silently breaking GHL API replies, the
`cron.jobs` JSON block failing validation on openclaw 2026.5.27, GHL having no API/MCP for building
automations (Build-with-AI is the only path), and the Mac-specific `cloudflared` launchd install
needing interactive sudo. Baked all the fixes into the skill so no Mac client stalls on them.

### Added
- `references/GHL-INBOUND-AND-PLAYBOOKS.md` (NEW) — authoritative Mac reference: 4-token table,
  one-tunnel-many-hooks model, copy-paste **Build-with-AI prompt** template (placeholders
  PUBLIC_HOSTNAME / HOOK_PATH / HOOKS_TOKEN / CHANNEL), post-build verification checklist (incl.
  real-inbound-test caveat), Reusable Tunnel Values storage rule (AGENTS.md + TOOLS.md + client
  Notion), JSON one-value-per-key rule, verified channel→`type` enum (valid: SMS/Email/FB/IG/
  WhatsApp/Live_Chat; invalid: TikTok/Call/GMB + long-forms), Conversations reply recipe, Calendar
  recipe (free-slots epoch-MILLIS, book/reschedule/cancel), first playbook = appointment booking.
- `scripts/skill38-calendar-sync.sh` (NEW) — weekly GHL calendar refresh; rewrites the
  `<!-- GHL_CALENDARS_START/END -->` block in TOOLS.md. Auto-detects Mac vs VPS env/paths. Generic
  per-client. Registered via `openclaw cron add --name skill38-calendar-sync --cron "0 9 * * 0" ...`.

### Changed (surgical edits to references/v5.14-source-playbook.md)
- Step 3C + Step 3.5G: `deliver: true` → `deliver: false` on GHL reply hooks, with corrected
  rationale (true makes the gateway try to deliver to a non-existent default chatId → reply never sends).
- Step 3A: added the 4-token disambiguation table; Mac note (no Hostinger wrapper → hooks.token in
  openclaw.json is stable; no OPENCLAW_HOOKS_TOKEN env trick).
- All cron registrations → `openclaw cron add` CLI flag form, with a banner that `cron.jobs` JSON
  does not validate on openclaw 2026.5.27.
- Step 9.20 D.2: "Workflow AI prompt" → "Build-with-AI prompt"; Build-with-AI is PRIMARY, manual
  node-build demoted to FALLBACK; verification checklist required even on success; F.6 Reusable Tunnel
  Values; F.7 base SMS automation also creates the first appointment-booking playbook and wires the
  hook to it.
- Part 2 (Client Reference Sheet / Notion-doc spec) rewritten ordering: Reusable Tunnel Values →
  Build-with-AI prompt per channel → verification checklist; manual webhook build moved to fallback.
- Rules of Engagement: added Rule 7 (one value per key — proper JSON structure).
- Standardized `GHL_PRIVATE_INTEGRATION_TOKEN` + `Version: 2021-04-15` on the Conversations/Calendar
  path (was `<GHL_PIT_TOKEN>`). `GOHIGHLEVEL_AGENCY_PIT` is not present in this repo.
- Calendar action: verified endpoints (free-slots epoch-millis; appointments required fields; PUT/DELETE).
- Mac cloudflared step: kept launchd `sudo cloudflared service install` but flagged the
  interactive-sudo requirement prominently (cannot run over non-interactive rescue SSH).

# Skill 38 — Conversational AI System: Changelog

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-28 - Initial release (packages v5.14 playbook)

### Why
Christy's v5.14 conversational AI playbook (~8,800 lines, 14 version iterations) packaged as
an installable skill. Builds the conversational AI BRAIN on top of skill 29 (GHL Convert and Flow).

### Added
- 27 protocol files (humanizer NOT included; skill 19 owns it)
- 8 customer journey templates (coach fully detailed; 7 stubbed)
- 9 idempotent + OS-aware install scripts (00 prerequisites → 08 Shopify wizard)
- 7 reference documents including the FULL v5.14 source playbook + strategic roadmap
- SKILL.md, INSTALL.md, INSTRUCTIONS.md, EXAMPLES.md, CORE_UPDATES.md
- AGENTS.md Steps 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.8; upgraded Step 1.75
- MEMORY.md design rules 6-14
- 4 cron jobs (Sunday 2am tune-up, Saturday 11pm proactive + 11:30pm model freshness, 1st-of-month review)

### Source of truth
- `references/v5.14-source-playbook.md` — the canonical 8,797-line playbook
- `references/conversational-ai-strategic-roadmap.md` — strategic context (✅ shipped vs 📋 pending)

### Out of scope (DEFERRED, not in this skill)
- F14 Voice/Phone Integration
- F15 Proactive Outreach Campaigns
- F16 A/B Testing of Reply Variants
- F17 Customer Segmentation Awareness
- F18 Webhook Chaining
- F21 Multi-Tenant Agent Isolation

The skill's structure (numbered scripts, protocols/ folder, references/) leaves room for
these to be added later without restructuring.
