# Skill 38 — Conversational AI System: Changelog

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-28 - Initial release (packages v5.14 playbook)

### Why
Christy's v5.14 conversational AI playbook (~8,800 lines, 14 version iterations) packaged as
an installable skill. Builds the conversational AI BRAIN on top of skill 29 (GHL Convert and Flow).

### Added
- 27 protocol files (humanizer NOT included; skill 19 owns it)
- 8 customer journey templates (coach fully detailed; 7 stubbed)
- 9 idempotent + OS-aware install scripts (00 prerequisites → 08 Shopify wizard)
- 7 reference documents including the FULL v5.14 source playbook + strategic roadmap
- SKILL.md, INSTALL.md, INSTRUCTIONS.md, EXAMPLES.md, CORE_UPDATES.md
- AGENTS.md Steps 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.8; upgraded Step 1.75
- MEMORY.md design rules 6-14
- 4 cron jobs (Sunday 2am tune-up, Saturday 11pm proactive + 11:30pm model freshness, 1st-of-month review)

### Source of truth
- `references/v5.14-source-playbook.md` — the canonical 8,797-line playbook
- `references/conversational-ai-strategic-roadmap.md` — strategic context (✅ shipped vs 📋 pending)

### Out of scope (DEFERRED, not in this skill)
- F14 Voice/Phone Integration
- F15 Proactive Outreach Campaigns
- F16 A/B Testing of Reply Variants
- F17 Customer Segmentation Awareness
- F18 Webhook Chaining
- F21 Multi-Tenant Agent Isolation

The skill's structure (numbered scripts, protocols/ folder, references/) leaves room for
these to be added later without restructuring.
