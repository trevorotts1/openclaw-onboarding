# GHL Inbound + Conversation Playbooks — Authoritative Reference (Mac mini / Homebrew)

> **Scope:** This is the canonical, verified reference for wiring GoHighLevel (Convert and Flow)
> inbound messages into OpenClaw and building the agent's conversation playbooks, **for the
> Mac-mini / Homebrew install** (paths `~/clawd/…` and `~/.openclaw/…`, `cloudflared` via launchd).
> It is derived from a live build and supersedes any conflicting prose in
> `v5.14-source-playbook.md`. Where the source playbook and this doc disagree, **this doc wins.**
>
> **Mac vs VPS divergences are flagged inline.** The biggest two:
> 1. `cloudflared` runs via **launchd** (`sudo cloudflared service install`) — needs **interactive sudo**.
> 2. There is **NO Hostinger wrapper**, so the `HOOKS_TOKEN` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` is **stable** —
>    no `OPENCLAW_HOOKS_TOKEN` env trick needed (the VPS repo needs it; the Mac repo does not).

## CORRECTED GHL HOOK STRUCTURE (2026-05-29)

> Verified LIVE on Corey / Explore Growth, OpenClaw **2026.5.27**. This **supersedes** any older nested-body
> or in-body-`messageTemplate` example anywhere in this skill (this doc, `v5.14-source-playbook.md`, the
> scripts, and the templates).

**CARDINAL RULE — TWO separate objects in TWO systems; never put one inside the other:**
- **(A) GHL Custom Webhook RAW BODY = DATA ONLY, FLAT, no nesting, and it must NOT contain a `messageTemplate`.**
- **(B) OpenClaw `hooks.mappings` entry (`openclaw.json`) = config + the `messageTemplate`. The `messageTemplate` is SERVER-SIDE ONLY.**

**1) GHL RAW BODY MUST BE FLAT (no nested objects).** Nested `contact:{…}` / `customer_message:{…}` makes
EVERY field resolve EMPTY at the hook (proven: even a hardcoded `"channel":"sms"` arrived blank when nested).
Canonical correct flat body:

```json
{
  "channel": "sms",
  "contact_id": "{{contact.id}}",
  "first_name": "{{contact.first_name}}",
  "last_name": "{{contact.last_name}}",
  "email": "{{contact.email}}",
  "phone": "{{contact.phone}}",
  "subject": "{{message.subject}}",
  "message_body": "{{message.body}}",
  "match": "ghl-sales",
  "session_key": "hook:ghl:sms:{{contact.id}}",
  "agent_id": "sales",
  "location_id": "{{location.id}}",
  "location_name": "{{location.name}}"
}
```

**2) NEVER put a `messageTemplate` in the GHL body.** GHL expands the `{{contact_id}}` / `{{message_body}}`
placeholders inside it as ITS OWN merge fields, fails (they are not valid GHL field names), mangles them to
`##{}##` and drops the closing quote ⇒ GHL error "Error while parsing the object to JSON" ⇒ webhook Skipped.
The `messageTemplate` lives ONLY on the server mapping.

**3) The server mapping REQUIRES a `messageTemplate`.** With none, the hook returns
`{"ok":false,"error":"hook mapping requires message"}`.

**4) The server `messageTemplate` MUST include the instruction to reply via the GHL Conversations API**, or
the agent drafts a reply but never sends it (zero GHL API calls ⇒ customer gets nothing). Canonical correct
mapping (`openclaw.json` `hooks.mappings` entry):

```json
{
  "id": "ghl-sales",
  "match": { "path": "ghl-sales" },
  "action": "agent",
  "agentId": "sales",
  "model": "ollama/deepseek-v4-flash:cloud",
  "wakeMode": "now",
  "name": "GHL Sales Inbound",
  "sessionKey": "{{session_key}}",
  "messageTemplate": "Contact {{contact_id}}: {{message_body}} -- You are the Sales agent. Reply to contact {{contact_id}} via the GHL Conversations API per TOOLS.md (check conversation-workflows for the matching playbook).",
  "deliver": false,
  "timeoutSeconds": 300
}
```

The `messageTemplate` references the FLAT body key names (`{{contact_id}}`, `{{message_body}}`), and
`sessionKey:"{{session_key}}"` pulls the flat `session_key` the body sends.

**5) `deliver` MUST be `false`.** `deliver:true` makes OpenClaw ALSO try to push the reply to a channel,
conflicting with the agent's own GHL-API reply.

**6) There is NO GHL merge tag for channel / message-type.** Hardcode `"channel":"sms"` in the body (one
workflow per channel; for multi-channel branch on the Customer-Replied trigger's Reply-Channel filter and
hardcode per branch).

**7) Body VALUES use GHL's real merge tokens** (`{{contact.id}}`, `{{contact.first_name}}`,
`{{contact.last_name}}`, `{{contact.email}}`, `{{contact.phone}}`, `{{message.body}}`, `{{message.subject}}`,
`{{location.id}}`, `{{location.name}}`) and MUST be inserted via GHL's **Custom Values picker** (typed-as-text
tokens send empty). The body KEY NAMES (`contact_id`, `message_body`, etc.) are what OpenClaw reads/maps.

**8) A body-supplied or templated `sessionKey` requires `hooks.allowRequestSessionKey=true` AND
`hooks.allowedSessionKeyPrefixes`** (e.g. `["hook:"]`). Without any `sessionKey`, all contacts collapse into
one shared `hook:ghl:default` session (their conversations merge).

**9) `agentId` is NOT templatable in a mapping** (a `{{…}}` agentId silently falls back to the default agent).
To push the target agent from the webhook, POST to `/hooks/agent` (it reads top-level body fields `agentId`,
`sessionKey`, `message`, `name`, `channel`, `to`, `model`, `thinking` directly). Otherwise use one hook PATH
per agent with `agentId` hardcoded.

**10) `fallbacks` is NOT a valid `hooks.mappings` key** (the schema is `.strict()` and rejects it). It belongs
only on a model-routing config.

**11) `GHL_LOCATION_ID` (env) is the REQUIRED GHL API credential the agent uses to send the reply.** It is NOT
the `location_id` / `location_name` body merge fields. Keep the env credential; the `location_*` body fields
are optional data only.

**12) Valid `hooks.mappings` keys (`.strict()` schema, 2026.5.27):** `id`, `match`, `action`, `agentId`,
`model`, `wakeMode`, `name`, `sessionKey`, `messageTemplate`, `textTemplate`, `deliver`,
`allowUnsafeExternalContent`, `channel`, `to`, `thinking`, `timeoutSeconds`, `transform`.

## 1. The FOUR tokens — keep them disambiguated

This is the #1 source of confusion. There are exactly four secrets. Conflating any two breaks the install.

| # | Secret | Example format | Direction | Create-once vs reuse |
|---|--------|----------------|-----------|----------------------|
| 1 | `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (= "Cloudflare API key" — the SAME secret, two names) | `cfut_…` | Agent → Cloudflare API (build tunnel + DNS) | Client creates it; agent uses it **ONCE** during setup. |
| 2 | Tunnel **connector token** | `eyJ…` (long JWT-looking) | `cloudflared` ↔ Cloudflare edge | Created once when the tunnel is created; `cloudflared` runs with it forever. |
| 3 | `HOOKS_TOKEN` | 64-hex, e.g. `527cef27…` | GHL → OpenClaw (INBOUND `Authorization: Bearer`) | Created once; **shared by ALL hooks**; does not change. This is the token you paste into the Build-with-AI prompt header. |
| 4 | `GHL_PRIVATE_INTEGRATION_TOKEN` (PIT) | `pit-9f…` | Agent → GHL API (OUTBOUND, send replies / book) | Created once in GHL; the agent uses it as Bearer for every Conversations/Calendar call. |

**Mnemonic:**
- #1 builds the pipe (once).
- #2 runs the pipe (forever, via cloudflared/launchd).
- #3 lets GHL knock on the door (inbound auth, OpenClaw verifies).
- #4 lets the agent talk back to GHL (outbound, send the reply / book the appointment).

**Where they live on a Mac:** `~/clawd/secrets/.env` and/or `~/.openclaw/.env`. The `hooks.token`
also lives in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` and — because there is no Hostinger wrapper — it is **stable**
(not rewritten on boot). Do **not** use `OPENCLAW_HOOKS_TOKEN` env trickery on Mac.

---

## 2. One-tunnel-many-hooks model

The tunnel + hostname + connector token + `HOOKS_TOKEN` are created **ONCE**. Every new automation
adds a **new hook path** under the same hostname — you do **NOT** create a new tunnel.

```
https://<PUBLIC_HOSTNAME>/hooks/ghl-inbound-sms      → SMS automation
https://<PUBLIC_HOSTNAME>/hooks/ghl-inbound-email    → Email automation
https://<PUBLIC_HOSTNAME>/hooks/stripe-events        → Stripe automation
                       ▲                  ▲
              same tunnel + hostname   distinct hook path per automation
```

Each new hook path = one new entry in `hooks.mappings` (distinct `id` + `match.path`), reusing the
same `HOOKS_TOKEN`. **Never recreate the tunnel to add an automation.**

---

## 3. JSON structure rule (BINDING)

**One value per key — proper JSON structure. Never cram multiple distinct values into a single string
field. Each field gets its own key (nested or flat).**

```jsonc
// WRONG — packed string, breaks downstream parsers, unreadable to the next agent:
{ "tunnel": "id=abc123; token=eyJ...; host=client.example.com" }

// RIGHT — one value per key:
{
  "tunnel_id": "abc123",
  "connector_token": "eyJ...",
  "public_hostname": "client.example.com"
}
```

This applies to every config edit, every hook payload, every secrets-env record, and the Reusable
Tunnel Values record (Section 5). It is Rule 7 of the playbook's Rules of Engagement.

---

## 4. Build-with-AI prompt TEMPLATE (the operator pastes this into GHL)

**GHL / Convert and Flow has NO API and NO MCP for building automations.** The only way to build one
programmatically-ish is the **"Build with AI"** feature: Automations → **Build with AI** → paste a prompt
→ Publish. The agent's job is to generate a precise, copy-paste-ready prompt with every value substituted.

> Placeholders: `{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}`, `{{HOOK_PATH}}`, `{{HOOKS_TOKEN}}`, `{{CHANNEL}}`.
> `{{CHANNEL}}` must be one of the VALID send types in Section 7 (`SMS`, `Email`, `FB`, `IG`,
> `WhatsApp`, `Live_Chat`).

```
Build a workflow for me with these exact specifications:

TRIGGER:
- Type: "Customer Replied"
- Filter: Reply Channel = "{{CHANNEL}}"

ACTIONS (in this exact order):
- Action 1: "Send Custom Webhook" (NOT GHL's native webhook action)
  - URL: https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}/hooks/{{HOOK_PATH}}
  - Method: POST
  - AUTHORIZATION dropdown: None   (the token goes in Headers, not this dropdown)
  - Headers:
    - Authorization: Bearer {{HOOKS_TOKEN}}
    - Content-Type: application/json
  - Body (Raw JSON, exact — FLAT, no nested objects, NO messageTemplate):
    {
      "channel": "{{CHANNEL}}",
      "contact_id": "{{contact.id}}",
      "first_name": "{{contact.first_name}}",
      "last_name": "{{contact.last_name}}",
      "email": "{{contact.email}}",
      "phone": "{{contact.phone}}",
      "subject": "{{message.subject}}",
      "message_body": "{{message.body}}",
      "match": "ghl-sales",
      "session_key": "hook:ghl:{{CHANNEL}}:{{contact.id}}",
      "agent_id": "sales",
      "location_id": "{{location.id}}",
      "location_name": "{{location.name}}"
    }

PUBLISH: Yes, publish the workflow when done — do not leave it as a draft.
```

> **CRITICAL (verified live on Corey/Explore Growth 2026-05-29, OpenClaw 2026.5.27):** the GHL RAW BODY
> MUST be FLAT — no nested `contact:{…}` / `customer_message:{…}` objects. A nested body makes EVERY field
> resolve EMPTY at the hook (even a hardcoded `"channel":"sms"` arrived blank when nested). The body is
> DATA ONLY and must NEVER contain a `messageTemplate` — GHL tries to expand the template's `{{…}}` as its

The agent saves the filled-in prompt as
`<MASTER_FILES_DIR>/conversation-workflows/<workflow-id>--build-with-ai-prompt.md` and tells the operator
to paste it into Automations → Build with AI.

---

## 5. Post-build VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (REQUIRED — even when Build with AI "succeeds")

Build with AI frequently gets the scaffold right but silently mangles one critical piece. **Always run
this against the built workflow**, item by item. Each item names the failure mode AND the fix.

- [ ] **URL is EXACTLY** `https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}/hooks/{{HOOK_PATH}}` — no trailing slash, correct path.
      FIX: click the webhook action → URL field → paste exact URL.
- [ ] **Method is POST** (not GET/PUT). FIX: Method dropdown → POST.
- [ ] **AUTHORIZATION dropdown is "None"** — the token goes in Headers, NOT this dropdown.
      FIX: set dropdown to None, then add the header below.
- [ ] **`Authorization: Bearer {{HOOKS_TOKEN}}` header present, with the CORRECT token** (HOOKS_TOKEN — secret #3,
      not the PIT, not the gateway token). FIX: re-add the header, paste HOOKS_TOKEN exactly, no extra spaces.
- [ ] **`Content-Type: application/json` header present** (and the Content-Type dropdown set to application/json).
- [ ] **Raw Body matches the template field-for-field AND is FLAT (no nested objects)** — flat keys
      `channel`, `contact_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `phone`, `subject`, `message_body`, `match`,
      `session_key`, `agent_id`, `location_id`, `location_name`. Watch for Build with AI re-nesting fields into
      `contact:{…}` / `customer_message:{…}` (a nested body makes every field arrive EMPTY) or injecting a
      `messageTemplate` into the body (GHL mangles it → webhook Skipped). FIX: paste the exact FLAT Raw JSON
      from Section 4; the `messageTemplate` belongs ONLY on the server mapping, never in the body.
- [ ] **Body values were inserted via GHL's Custom Values picker** (not typed as plain text). Typed-as-text
      `{{contact.id}}`-style tokens send EMPTY. FIX: delete the typed token, re-insert via the merge-field picker.
- [ ] **Trigger is "Customer Replied"** filtered to the right Reply Channel.
- [ ] **Workflow is PUBLISHED, not Draft.** FIX: top-right → Publish.
- [ ] **REAL inbound test performed.** Send an actual message on the channel and confirm OpenClaw received it
      and the agent replied. **Do NOT rely on GHL's in-builder "Test" button** — it sends empty merge fields and
      passes even when the live payload is broken.

---

## 6. Reusable Tunnel Values — storage rule (BINDING, every time, kept updated)

Store the reusable assets — **one value per key (Section 3)** — under a **"Reusable Tunnel Values"** section
in **ALL THREE** of these, and keep them in sync whenever a value changes or a new hook is added:

1. **AGENTS.md** (`## Reusable Tunnel Values`)
2. **TOOLS.md** (`## Reusable Tunnel Values`)
3. **The client's own Notion doc** (never co-mingle with another client's workspace)

Record:

```json
{
  "public_hostname": "<PUBLIC_HOSTNAME>",
  "hooks_token": "<HOOKS_TOKEN>",
  "tunnel_id": "<TUNNEL_ID>",
  "connector_token_ref": "secrets/.env:TUNNEL_TOKEN",
  "hook_path_registry": [
    {
      "hook_path": "ghl-inbound-sms",
      "automation_name": "OpenClaw — Inbound SMS",
      "channel": "SMS",
      "playbook_path": "conversation-workflows/appointment-booking.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

> For the connector token, store a **reference** to the secrets-env key (not the raw `eyJ…` value) in
> Notion/AGENTS.md/TOOLS.md. The raw value lives only in `~/clawd/secrets/.env` / `~/.openclaw/.env`.

---

## 7. Verified channel → `type` enum (GHL Conversations API send)

**Endpoint:** `POST https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/conversations/messages`
**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <GHL_PRIVATE_INTEGRATION_TOKEN>`, `Version: 2021-04-15`, `Content-Type: application/json`

| Channel | `type` value (VALID) | Required body fields |
|---|---|---|
| SMS | `SMS` | `contactId`, `locationId`, `message` |
| Email | `Email` | `contactId`, `locationId`, `subject`, `html`, `emailFrom`, `emailTo` |
| Facebook Messenger | `FB` | `contactId`, `locationId`, `message` |
| Instagram DM | `IG` | `contactId`, `locationId`, `message` |
| WhatsApp | `WhatsApp` | `contactId`, `locationId`, `message` |
| Live Chat | `Live_Chat` | `contactId`, `locationId`, `message` |

**VALID send types (the complete list):** `SMS`, `Email`, `FB`, `IG`, `WhatsApp`, `Live_Chat`.

**INVALID — the API rejects these as a send `type`:** `TikTok`, `Call`, `GMB`, and the long-forms
`Instagram`, `Facebook`, `Webchat`. **TikTok inbound exists** as a channel, but there is **no TikTok API
send type** — you cannot reply to TikTok via this endpoint. Always use the short codes (`FB`, `IG`).

---

## 8. GHL Conversations reply recipe (OUTBOUND)

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/conversations/messages" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GHL_PRIVATE_INTEGRATION_TOKEN" \
  -H "Version: 2021-04-15" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "type": "SMS",
    "contactId": "<contactId>",
    "locationId": "<locationId>",
    "message": "<reply text>"
  }'
```

Swap `type` + required fields per the enum in Section 7. For Email, include `subject`, `html`,
`emailFrom`, `emailTo` instead of `message`.

---

## 9. GHL Calendar recipe (VERIFIED)

All Calendar calls use the same headers as Section 8 (PIT Bearer, `Version: 2021-04-15`).

**Availability (free-slots):** epoch **MILLISECONDS** for `startDate`/`endDate`.
```
GET /calendars/{calendarId}/free-slots?startDate={epochMillis}&endDate={epochMillis}
```

**Book appointment:** REQUIRED `calendarId`, `locationId`, `contactId`, `startTime`. `endTime` is OPTIONAL
(the calendar's slot duration fills it). The response returns the appointment `id`.
```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/calendars/events/appointments" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GHL_PRIVATE_INTEGRATION_TOKEN" \
  -H "Version: 2021-04-15" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "calendarId": "<calendarId>",
    "locationId": "<locationId>",
    "contactId": "<contactId>",
    "startTime": "<ISO8601 start>"
  }'
```

**Reschedule:** `PUT /calendars/events/appointments/{eventId}`
**Cancel:** `DELETE /calendars/events/{eventId}`

> Epoch-millis gotcha: GHL free-slots expects milliseconds. `date +%s` gives seconds — multiply by 1000.
> `startDate=$(( $(date +%s) * 1000 ))`.

---

## 10. First conversation playbook = APPOINTMENT BOOKING (Layer 2 template)

The base SMS automation MUST also create this first conversation playbook and wire the SMS hook path to it,
so every fresh install ships one working end-to-end conversation (inbound SMS → agent → booked appointment).

Save as `<MASTER_FILES_DIR>/conversation-workflows/appointment-booking.md`:

```markdown
# Conversation Playbook: Appointment Booking

## When to invoke
Customer asks to book / schedule / set up a meeting, demo, consultation, or appointment.

## Behavior (Layer 2)
1. Identify the service + preferred time window. If unspecified, ask which service; if one calendar exists, default to it.
2. Check availability:
   GET /calendars/{BOOKING_CALENDAR_ID}/free-slots?startDate={nowMillis}&endDate={nowPlus7dMillis}
   (epoch MILLISECONDS). Prioritize slots in the first 72 hours.
3. Offer the customer 2–3 specific times in the reply (date + time + timezone).
4. When the customer picks one, book it:
   POST /calendars/events/appointments
   { "calendarId": "{BOOKING_CALENDAR_ID}", "locationId": "{LOCATION_ID}",
     "contactId": "{contactId}", "startTime": "<chosen ISO time>" }
   Capture the returned appointment `id`.
5. Confirm back to the customer: time, date, timezone, any prep info.
6. On a later reschedule request → PUT /calendars/events/appointments/{eventId}.
   On a cancel request → DELETE /calendars/events/{eventId}.

## Guardrails
- Never offer a slot outside the operator's booking window (default 7 days) or inside min lead time (default 2h).
- After 3 declined offers, escalate to the operator.
- Reply on the same channel the customer used (per the inbound hook's {{channel}}).
```

Register it in `conversation-workflows/registry.md` and add its hook-path entry to the Reusable Tunnel
Values hook-path registry (Section 6).

---

## 11. Mac cloudflared (launchd) — interactive-sudo blocker

```bash
brew list cloudflared || brew install cloudflared
sudo cloudflared service install <CONNECTOR_TOKEN>   # secret #2 (eyJ…)
```

> **🛑 BLOCKER:** `sudo cloudflared service install` prompts for the admin password and **cannot run over a
> non-interactive rescue SSH session** (no TTY). If operating remotely, STOP and hand this one command to the
> operator to run in a local Terminal (or an interactive TTY SSH session), then resume once they confirm the
> LaunchDaemon is installed. This was a real onboarding blocker — don't let the install silently stall here.

On macOS this writes `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cloudflare.cloudflared.plist` (`RunAtLoad=true`,
`KeepAlive=true`). Verify: `sudo launchctl list | grep com.cloudflare.cloudflared` (PID must be a number),
and run the restart-survival test (`kill -9` the PID, confirm a new PID appears).

---

## 12. `deliver: false` on GHL reply hooks (CRITICAL)

The inbound hook's mapping MUST set `"deliver": false`. With `deliver: true`, the gateway tries to publish
the agent's response to the agent's **default** channel binding — which for a GHL-only agent has no `chatId`
— and fails with `"Delivering to Telegram requires target <chatId>"`. The agent's real reply (sent OUTBOUND
via the GHL Conversations API, Section 8) then never reaches the customer. The agent already delivers its own
reply, so the hook must not deliver it again. **Always `deliver: false` for API-reply hooks.**

---

## 13. Cron registration on openclaw 2026.5.27 — use the CLI, not `cron.jobs` JSON

The `cron.jobs` JSON block does **NOT** validate on openclaw 2026.5.27. Register every cron via the CLI:

```bash
openclaw cron add \
  --name <job-name> \
  --cron "<cron-expr>" \
  --agent main \
  --message "<instruction>" \
  --light-context \
  --best-effort-deliver
```

Example (weekly calendar sync, Section 14):
```bash
openclaw cron add --name skill38-calendar-sync --cron "0 9 * * 0" --agent main \
  --light-context --best-effort-deliver \
  --message "run ~/clawd/scripts/skill38-calendar-sync.sh ~/.openclaw/workspace/TOOLS.md and report calendar count"
```

---

## 14. Calendar sync script

`scripts/skill38-calendar-sync.sh` pulls the client's current GHL calendars weekly and rewrites the marked
`<!-- GHL_CALENDARS_START -->` … `<!-- GHL_CALENDARS_END -->` table in TOOLS.md (adds new calendars, removes
ones that no longer exist). It auto-detects Mac vs VPS env/paths. Install it to `~/clawd/scripts/` and register
the Sunday 9am cron per Section 13.
