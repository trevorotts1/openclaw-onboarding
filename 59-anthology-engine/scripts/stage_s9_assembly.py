"""stage_s9_assembly.py -- thin stage dispatcher for s9 (ANTHOLOGY ASSEMBLY).

WIRING CONTRACT (authored by W1.1; module logic authored by sibling units).
This is a THIN RUNNER: it validates inputs, resolves the ordered collaborators
below, and hands off. It implements NO module logic. The serial integrator wires
the concrete argv per collaborator into _invoke_wiring(); the resolution order and
the exit-code classification contract are FIXED here.

S9 assembly (two producer decisions bracket it): the ready-to-assemble trigger (gate
s9_ready, all PRD 3.11 guards WRITER-enforced: own-producer auth, every participant
approved or explicitly excluded, at least min_chapters frozen approved chapters, typed
anthology-name confirmation, one-way) opens it; the final sign-off (gate s9_producer)
closes it. Fired from the Assembly card or the readiness nudge, both doors one endpoint.

Persona (PRD Section 13): anthology-producer-orchestrator speaking the Anthology Editor voice (ae-01 to ae-04), subordinate to producer inputs.

Exit codes (SPEC 3.4 row 6; house: 1 unexpected error):
  0  stage complete and persisted
  2  prover failure (counts a QC attempt)
  3  held (credits, lost callback, or a collaborator not yet wired)
  5  unresolved prompt slot (AF-AE-SLOT-UNRESOLVED)
