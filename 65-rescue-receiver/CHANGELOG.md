# Changelog - 65 Rescue Receiver (65-rescue-receiver)

## [23.1.0] - 2026-09-09 - RR-004 additive lease/attempt fields (RECEIVER_VERSION 1.4.0)

RR-W2-CORE RR-004 pairing. ADDITIVE ONLY, no behavior change: the claim
response's new `attempt_id` / `attempt_generation` / `lease_expires_at` fields
are parsed and echoed verbatim on every ack, so the server can fence
acknowledgments against the current lease owner (rejecting stale generations,
expired leases and replaced owners). Fields are omitted when the server does
not send them (pre-RR-004 servers unaffected). Strict enforcement arrives
later, only after the additive server contract is confirmed fleet-wide
(SPEC shared rollout contract). Skill package version 23.0.0 -> 23.1.0.

## [23.0.0] - 2026-09-03 - v23 major generation bump: no behavior change, version roll only

No functional changes. Version advanced to the next major generation alongside the v23.0.0 repo release.
