# Generation execution path (the command that was missing)

Authority: `references/kie-generation-route.md` for the route. This file only names the
execution command and its input record.

`scripts/shared_page_service.py` admits a page; `scripts/stage_gate.py` checks and closes a
stage. Neither produces an image. `scripts/stage_executor.py` is the production command the
service's documented `--pipeline-command` seam expects, and it is the command a
`scripts/swarm_runner.py` `--worker-cmd` worker can run for one generation item.

## Command

```sh
# the four image stages, end to end (inert by default)
python3 scripts/stage_executor.py <run_dir> --provider stub

# the real route: Skill 74, one `run --mode active` per image
python3 scripts/stage_executor.py <run_dir> --provider kie --allow-paid

# one item, as a runner worker command (generic-shell runtime)
python3 scripts/stage_executor.py <run_dir> --stage image-generation-qc --item IMG-001
```

`--provider kie` refuses unless `--allow-paid` is passed AND `KIE_API_KEY` is set. The key is
never printed. Skill 74 is found at `--kie-adapter PATH`, else `SKILL71_KIE_ADAPTER`, else the
sibling `74-kie-live-adapter` skill; a missing adapter is a named failure.

## Production request

`<run_dir>/production-request.json`:

```json
{
  "model": "<id resolved by Skill 66>",
  "copy_version": "standard | long-form",
  "style": "<one-line direction>",
  "references": ["/abs/path/reference-1.png"],
  "stage_prompts": {"desktop-wireframe": "... {section_name} ... {copy} ... {slots} ... {width} ..."},
  "input_extra": {"<field the live schema requires>": "<value>"},
  "sections": [
    {"section_id": "hero", "section_name": "Hero", "copy": "...",
     "slots": [{"slot_id": "IMG-001", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "art_direction": "..."}]}
  ]
}
```

Each stage writes its images into its own stage folder and one
`<stage>/stage-executor-record.json` naming the file, its SHA-256, the prompt hash, the
provider, the mode and the task id. Later stages attach the actual PNGs the earlier stages
wrote as input references. The record is not a gate receipt: it cannot close a stage, and the
gate's validators and reviewers still run against the artifacts.

## Section count contract

One request section per canonical copy section of the selected form, never
band-compressed: Standard 12, Long-Form 15 (`references/copy-specs/<copy_version>-v6.json`,
`sequence`; Section 5 may expand to 5A, 5B, 5C, which makes 17). The form comes from the
request's `copy_version`, else its `metadata.copy_version`, else `<run_dir>/intake.json`.
`stage_executor.py` refuses, by name and before any prompt is composed, a request whose
canonical section ids (`S02A`, `02A` and `2A` all read as `2A`) differ from that sequence,
from the request's copy source (`copy_source` file), or from `copy/copy-manifest.json`. A
free run with no declared form prints a NOTE and skips the check; a paid run
(`--provider kie`) refuses. `--preflight` prints `PREFLIGHT_SECTIONS` (form, count, ids) and one
`PREFLIGHT_CTA` per section.

`scripts/build_production_request.py` is the request builder for this path. It reads
`copy/internal-manuscript.md`, writes one section per canonical id with the section's public
copy, its single CTA label, optional image slots (`--slots`) and optional design prose packed
to the model's 95 percent target (`--design-prose`), and runs the same check on its own
output before writing. A section's copy may end on a short closing line (a chip label or a
signature) without terminal punctuation; unfinished prose is still refused. Templates may use
`{section_total}` and `{layout}` besides the placeholders listed under Production request.

## Prompt and geometry contract

The executor enforces four rules on every job before a paid call; `--preflight`
composes and checks them with no provider call and no file write.

1. **Verbatim copy first.** The section's `copy` is the first block and appears
   once, followed by the exact CTA label. The run's production prose is never
   inside the copy block.
2. **Incomplete copy is refused.** A copy string that carries style padding
   ("Preserve the measured band order", …) or ends mid-sentence fails by
   section name, because a paid render of truncated copy is a wasted call.
3. **Provenance is stripped.** Local paths, reference filenames, hashes and the
   reference raster's absolute pixel size are removed; measured ratios and
   design tokens stay. The prompt states the target ratio and the full-frame
   contract (one section, no blank bands, no letterboxing).
4. **One section in, one section out.** Each job receives only the same-index
   slices of earlier stages, same platform first. It never receives every
   section at once, and its ratio is derived from its pixel-mate and snapped to
   the route's ratio enum (`RATIO_ENUM`), not one fixed 3:4 for all parts.

Canvas geometry is per-image. `target_ratio()` derives each job's ratio from
its pixel-mate (or the section's slot), and the record carries
`requested_ratio` and `actual_pixels`; a delivered image more than 2% off the
requested ratio is recorded as `geometry_mismatch` and printed as a named
warning.

The assembly scripts `stitch_sections.py` and `build_hybrid_board.py` are
unchanged by this wire: they were already content-height. No assembly-canvas
fix is claimed here or in this change's history.

## Composition

`stitch_sections.py` (wireframe full-page PNG) and `build_hybrid_board.py` (mockup board) are
the repo's own pinned composers, unchanged by this wire. The executor runs them only in `kie`
mode and only when their own input records exist; both refuse to compose from inputs that do
not pass their validation. Stub mode never composes: a placeholder is not an approved input.
